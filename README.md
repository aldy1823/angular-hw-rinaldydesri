# AngularHwRinaldydesri

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.13.

## Setup

1. Please make sure you are using Node version 22.x.x LTS.
You can check your node version by running node -v in your terminal.
If you are using a different version, you can install the LTS version by following the instructions (Please use the LTS version) here.
2. Clone the repository and run npm install to install the dependencies.

## Change api key openweathermap

Open file src/app/environments/environments.ts then change api_key with your api key for access openweathermap api.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.


## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
